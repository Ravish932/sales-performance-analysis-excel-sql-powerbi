##  Dataset Details

The sales data is split into 6 country-wise sheets/tables:
- `India_Sales`, `UK_Sales`, `USA_Sales`, `Nigeria_Sales`, `Canada_Sales`, `China_Sales`

Each table contains sales-related columns:
- `Transaction_id`, `Date`, `Country`, `Product_id`, `Product_Name`, `Category`, `Price_Per_Unit`, `Quantity_Purchased`, `Cost_Price`, `Discount_Applied`, `Payment_Method`, `Customer_Age_Group `,
- `Customer_Gender`, `Store_Location`, `Sales_Rep`, `Total_Amount` `Profit`

## Objectives:Â The Primary goals were to:

- Analyze sales, profit, and order metrics across geographies.Â 
- Identify top-performing regions and cities.Â 
- Examine temporal trends (monthly and daily).Â 
- Evaluate the impact of payment methods, discounts, and product categories onÂ 
overall performance.Â 
- Create an interactive dashboard to visualize insights for stakeholders.Â 
- Six specific business questions were addressed using SQL queries, with resultsÂ 
visualized in Power BI.

##  Analysis & Insights:Â
